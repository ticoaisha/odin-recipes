    <h3>Easy Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
      This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy
      ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
      <li>meat sauce</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef.
        Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and
        garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in
        sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4
        cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato
        sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low
        and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap
        water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely
        immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and
        discard water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until
        ready to assemble lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the
        prepared pan. Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta
        cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2
        cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan
        cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers.
        To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of
        meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and
        Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
        additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
